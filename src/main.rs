// A Note on Using Migrations in Production:
// When preparing your app for use in production, you may want to run your migrations during the applicationâ€™s initialization phase. 
// You may also want to include the migration scripts as a part of your code, to avoid having to copy them to your deployment location/image etc.

// The diesel_migrations crate provides the embed_migrations! macro, allowing you to embed migration scripts in the final binary. 
// Once your code uses it, you can simply include connection.run_pending_migrations(MIGRATIONS) at the start of your main function to run migrations every time the application starts.
